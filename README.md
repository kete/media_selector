# media_selector

## Description

A jQuery and Sammy.js based mini-application for choosing from a list of providers' media assets (images, audio, video, etc.). Used OpenSearch and oEmbed.

## Installation

media_selector is meant as a building block for things like an image chooser in a WYSIWYG rich text editor, like TinyMCE. However, it can be used standalone as long as you set up media_selector/data/providers.json appropriately to point at a provider(s) that answers OpenSearch and oEmbed requests.

To set up, copy data/providers.json.example to data/providers.json and edit to suit.

## Usage

More to come.

## Dependencies

jQuery (through a link to Google's CDN) and Sammy.js along with some Sammy.js plugins (Sammy.js and plugins are included via git submodules).
